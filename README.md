# Etch-A-Sketch

This is the *Etch-A-Sketch* project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

## Summary

This project was event listener heavy, I think I've got a hang of it a bit. Also refactored a lot of my repetitive spaghetti code into functions, I think the code looks alright now.
